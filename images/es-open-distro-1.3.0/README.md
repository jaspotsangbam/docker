This image is an ALPHA version of the dockerfile and requisite build files that are provided with the primary purpose of illustrating dotCMS-distributed image functionality. It is NOT intended for building images for production use.  We encourage you to use the image provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/opendistro-for-elasticsearch rather than building your own image.  

Building custom images may create more complexity and challenges as it relates to the ongoing support of your installation.  Please contact support@dotcms.com to inquire about add-on product services available for extended support around Docker.  

dotCMS has architected this image to handle many different use cases, providing the best dotCMS product experience while still enabling use of custom functionality with the genuine dotCMS image.

Please send any thoughts or suggestions to improve our docker image to support@dotcms.com.  At the ALPHA release stage, this product is not feature-complete and additional functionality is still being added (and existing functionality may be changed although efforts will be made to minimize breaking changes). Once more comprehensive testing has been completed and input from our users has been incorporated, dotCMS will release official images recommended for use in production. 

If you feel you must create your own custom docker image(s), please contact dotCMS Support to discuss product compatibility and scope-of-support concerns prior to implementation.
